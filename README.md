This Terraform configuration file creates a DigitalOcean Kubernetes cluster with a WordPress application and a DigitalOcean managed database. It also sets up an Nginx Ingress controller to route traffic to the WordPress application, and creates a DNS record to point to the cluster endpoint.

Here is an overview of the resources that are created:

* DigitalOcean VPC
* DigitalOcean Firewall
* DigitalOcean Kubernetes cluster
* DigitalOcean managed database cluster
* Nginx Ingress controller
* DigitalOcean domain
* DNS record pointing to the cluster endpoint
* DigitalOcean certificate for the domain
